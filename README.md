# ambiguity-resolving-ANN
Contains MATLAB code for a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) that can be used to resolve ambiguity (due to multiple labels for a training point) and to assign a non-ambiguous label to a test point. multiTargetANN is a MATLAB code for an ambiguity resolving MLP. The input is a dataset where the data points are in the rows, and the corresponding class labels are in a cell array. multiTargetAll1, multiTargetRand2 and multiTargetMin3 are all alternative approaches to solve ambiguity. The supporting function required by all of the scripts is uniqueCell.
